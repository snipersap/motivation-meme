# motivation-meme
The project intends to build a meme for motivation using HTML and CSS. 

# Tech used
1. Project files from appbrewery by Dr. Angela Yu
2. Image files with creative commons license from flickr.com
3. Libre-Baskerville and Work Sans fonts from [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com)

# Learning
1. Used fonts.google.com to apply fonts to the text.
2. Using text-align in html element inside CSS aligns all elements including the image. 
3. Used element selector to apply CSS styles to the html elements.
4. Adding border and padding to the image leads to the image stretching beyond the box of the div containing it. Therefore, reduced the width of the image to 80%. 
5. Used height in img element to avoid layout shift.
6. Used % value in margin top, to eyeball the center of the div.
